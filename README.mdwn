# Metadata performance test for file create

touch-test.py tests filesystem metadata performance by touching
multiple files (actually an `open(path, 'a').close()`) in serial.

## Example

$ python touch-test.py 100000

## Features

* Generates random, 40-character filenames
* Prevents single-directory overload by distributing files into a
  prefix directory
* Generates filenames in-memory to eliminate RNG bottlenecks
* Creates distribution directories in advance
